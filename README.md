# CSAB-password-program

This program prompts a user to create a new password. A valid password:
must be at least 8 characters
contains at least one upper and one lowercase letter
contains at least one number
contains at least one special character (any non-alphabetic, non-numeric character)
cannot contain spaces
Once the first password is valid, the program prompts the user to re-enter the password a 2nd time
If the second password does not match the first, the program gives the user two more tries to submit a matching password.
After 3 incorrect second passwords, the whole process starts over from the beginning.
If the password is valid and both match, display a success message.
